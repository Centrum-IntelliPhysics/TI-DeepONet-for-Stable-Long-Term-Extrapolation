# TI-DeepONet-Learnable-Time-Integration-for-Stable-Long-Term-Extrapolation
We introduce two frameworks: TI-DeepONet and TI(L)-DeepONet; frameworks that integrate neural operators with adaptive numerical time-stepping techniques to preserve the Markovian structure of dynamical systems while substantially mitigating error propagation in extended temporal forecasting.
